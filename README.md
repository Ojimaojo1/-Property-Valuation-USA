# An Exploratory analysis of Residential Property Valuation in a select USA town.
The value of a housing property is per good measure, shaped by some endogenous and exogenous features so much so that a good and valuable property is likely to be described as one with the right balance of proximity to public amenities like schools, transport, hospitals, shops, and social scenery. 
 This report is intended as an inception component of a Comparative Market Analysis. It employs Python to carry out an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of The Residential Housing Prices in a USA town using data from 2006-2010. The results suggest that characteristics such as Overall quality, Gr Liv Area, and Total Bsmt SF, had a strong positive correlation with the sales price while features such as Overall Cond, Kitchen AbvGr, and Enclosed Porch had a weak negative correlation with the Sales price. Also, for the location, It is evident that houses like Stonebr, NridgHt, and NoRidge were the 3 most expensive neighbourhoods to buy a property while the cheapest neighbourhoods are BrDale, IDOTRR and MeadowV.
